## Introduction

**Soda** is a new gen C/C++ package manager that will bring you the experience of `npm`, `pip` or `cargo` ease of running, building, linking, testing, getting packages and so on. The main pillar of **Soda** - extendability dictates an ability to add aliases, control pipeline with TOML config and powerful CLI but also add your own variety of compilers and commands to CLI supported by API.

## Getting Started

## Overview

As you installed the **Soda** executable, you can use it to create a project by:

```bash

soda new PATH

```

It will create at PATH the C project with binary template. To change the language use flag `--cxx` and for library template `-l` or `--lib`.

For path in current directory use dot.

To build and link project, go to project directory and run

```console

soda build

```

By default it will build and link in debug mode, but specifying `-r` or `--release` you can change it.
